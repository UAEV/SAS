#High level overview of code


Main loop:
	Constantly polling accelerator pedal value

Timer5:
	Stops polling and starts ADC conversion.

ADC Conversion Finished:	
	Pushes what is in the ADC buffer (10 bit) into the Speed struct (least sig 8 into speedL, two most sig into speedH). 
	This might be changed by just dropping the two least significant values and keeping the 8 most significant

External Peripherial Interrupt:
	When the brake pedal comparator outputs any value this interrupt flag will be thrown
